When the projectors are parallel to each other and also perpendicular to the plane, the projection is called orthographic projection.

1   A plane of projection (POP)  is a plane on which a particular view is projected.

1   A plane of projection (POP)  is a plane on which a particular view is projected.
2   Three such planes, perpendicular to each other, are called
principal planes or reference planes (RP).

2   Three such planes, perpendicular to each other, are called

3   When the observer looks at the object from the front, the
view obtained is called the front view (FV) or Elevation. FV is seen on the VP.

4   When the observer looks at the object from above, the view obtained is called top view (TV) or plan. TV is seen on the HP.

5   Side Views When the observer looks at the object from side, i.e., from his left-hand side or right-hand side, the view obtained is called side view (SV). SV is seen on the PP.

Naming convention






1   The line denoting the intersection of HP and VP is reference line and denoted by xy, x1 y1, x2 y2 ....
2   All points in a plan or top view are denoted by small alphabets.  Any new position is denoted with suffix like a1,  a2,  a3  ...
3   All points in an elevation or front view are denoted by small alphabets with prime (‘).  Any new position is denoted with
suffix like a‘ ,  a‘ ,  a‘
