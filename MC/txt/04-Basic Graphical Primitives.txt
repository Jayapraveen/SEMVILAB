04  - Basic  Graphical  Primitives

Ex.  No.         :    4                                                           Roll  No.       :

Date                :                                   Reg.  No.       :

Aim

Develop  an  application  that  draws  basic  graphical  primitives  on  the screen.

Objective

This   application   uses  View   class   which   is used  to   draw   graphical items  on  to  the  android  app screen.

This   exercise   draws   some   graphic   primitives   using   Paint,   View, Canvas  and a method  onDraw().

The    android.graphics.Canvas    can   be   used    to    draw    graphics    in android.  It provides  methods  to  draw  oval,  rectangle,  picture,  text,  line etc.

The    android.graphics.Paint    class    is  used   with    canvas   to    draw objects.  It holds  the  information  of  color  and style.

Procedure

Create  a new  private  class  named  SampleCanvas.

private  class  SampleCanvas  {

}

Extend  the  View  class  to  the  SampleCanvas  class  we  just  created.

private  class  SampleCanvas  extends  View  {

}

Go  ahead  and edit  the  Java File. Now  you  can see  an error  message.
So  Press  [ALT]  +  [ENTER]  on  your  keyboard.

Now  you  will  get  a pop-up  saying  create  constructor  matching  super. Go  ahead  and select  it.
Now  another  window  will  open up  with  different  constructors.

Select  the  one with  just  a context  as parameter: View(context:Context)
public  SampleCanvas(Context  context)  {
super(context);
}

Now  a constructor  is automatically  generated  for  you.

Now   place   the   cursor   below   the   constructor   definition   and  press
[ALT]  +  [Insert]  and select  Override  Methods  from  the  popup   Menu.

Find         the         onDraw()         override         method         from         the         list onDraw(canvas:Canvas):void.

Click  OK.

@Override
protected  void  onDraw(Canvas  canvas)  {
super.onDraw(canvas);
}

Delete  the  super.onDraw(canvas).

@Override
protected  void  onDraw(Canvas  canvas)  {

}

Now  we  need to  create  a Paint  object.

So  above the  constructor  definition  add the  following  code: Paint  paint  =  new  Paint();
Now  we  will  start  drawing  inside  the  onDraw  method. Set  the  paint  color:
paint.setColor(Color.YELLOW); canvas.drawPaint(paint); paint.setTextSize(50);

Draw  a rectangle  : To  draw  a rectangle  we  use the  function:

canvas.drawRect(float   left,   float   top,   float   right,   float   bottom, Paint  paint);

The  arguments  can be depicted  as shown  below:

The  co-ordinates  of:

A  =  (left,  top)
B =  (right,  bottom)
paint  is the  paint  object  we  created. Lets  draw  a rectangle  now:
paint.setColor(Color.GREEN); canvas.drawText("Rectangle",  420,  150,  paint); canvas.drawRect(400,  200,  650,  700,  paint);

Drawing  a circle:
canvas.drawCircle(float  cx,  float  cy,  float  radius,  Paint  paint); Depiction:

The  co-ordinates  of  A  =  (cx,cy). And  the  length  AB  =  radius.

Let’s   draw   a  circle   with   fill color   green   center   at   (200,350)   and radius  150.

paint.setColor(Color.RED);
canvas.drawText("Circle",  120,  150,  paint);
canvas.drawCircle(200,                       350,                       150,                       paint); Drawing  a line:
canvas.drawLine(float    startX,    float    startY,    float    stopX,    float stopY,  Paint  paint);

Depiction

Draws   a  line   with   initial   point   at   (startX,   startY)   and  end  point at  (stopX,  stopY)

Let’s  draw  a line  from  point  (520,850)  to  (520,1150):

paint.setColor(Color.BLACK); canvas.drawText("Line",  480,  800,  paint); canvas.drawLine(520,  850,  520,  1150,  paint);

There   are  more   graphics   that   we   can  draw   into   the   canvas  let’s check them  out:

paint.setColor(Color.BLACK); paint.setStrokeWidth(3); canvas.drawPoint(200,  200,  paint);

Displaying  the  drawings. Define  a SampleCanvas  object:
SampleCanvas  drawView  =  new  SampleCanvas(this);

protected  void  onCreate(Bundle  savedInstanceState)  {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
SampleCanvas  drawView  =  new  SampleCanvas(this);
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
}

Now  set  the  content  view  to  drawView. setContentView(drawView);
protected  void  onCreate(Bundle  savedInstanceState)  {
super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
SampleCanvas  drawView  =  new  SampleCanvas(this);
setContentView(drawView);
}

Now  Run  the  application.
